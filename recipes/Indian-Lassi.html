        <p>People always ask me for an Indian Lassi recipe.
             I mean, it's not very complicated,
              but I realized it's only easy if you've done it all your life.
               It's embarrassingly simple, so to jazz it up I'll show you several variations of Lassi,
                all of which are traditional.
